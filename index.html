1   Introduction
The preparation of manuscripts which are to be reproduced by photo-offset requires 
special care. Papers submitted in a technically unsuitable form will be returned for 
retyping, or canceled if the volume cannot otherwise be finished on time.
1.1   LNCS Online
Springer-Verlag now provides the full-text version of the LNCS and LNAI proceed-
ings online. Therefore please submit to the volume editors (and NOT to Springer-
Verlag), together with your own single-sided printout of the final version of your con-
tribution (which cannot be modified at a later stage), your source (input) files, e.g. 
TEX files for the text and PS or EPS files for figures, the final DVI file (for papers 
prepared using LaTeX or TeX), the final PS file  and, if possible, a PDF file of the 
final version of your contribution. If you have prepared your paper using a text proc-
essing system other than LaTeX or TeX, please also submit RTF files. Make sure that 
the text is identical in all cases.
2   Manuscript Preparation
You are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX2e for the preparation of your camera-
ready manuscript together with the corresponding Springer class file llncs.cls; see 
Sect. 3. Only if you use LaTeX2e can hyperlinks be generated in the online version of 
your manuscript.
  If you are unable to use LaTeX, you may use MS Word together with the template 
sv-lncs.dot (see Sect. 4) or any other text processing system. In the latter case, please 
follow these instructions closely in order to make the volume look as uniform as pos-
sible.
  We would like to stress that the class/style files and the template should not be ma-
nipulated and that the guidelines regarding font sizes and format should be adhered to. 
This is to ensure that the end product is as homogeneous as possible.
2.1   Printing Area 
The printing area is 122 mm Âž 193 mm. The text should be justified to occupy the full 
line width, so that the right margin is not ragged, with words hyphenated as appropri-
ate. Please fill pages so that the length of the text is no less than 180 mm.
2.2   Layout, Typeface, Font Sizes, and Numbering
Use 10-point type for the name(s) of the author(s) and 9-point type for the address(es) 
and the abstract. For the main text, please use 10-point type and single-line spacing. 
We recommend using Computer Modern Roman (CM) fonts, Times, or one of the 
similar typefaces widely used in photo-typesetting. (In these typefaces the letters have 
serifs, i.e., short endstrokes at the head and the foot of letters.) Italic type may be used 
to emphasize words in running text. Bold type and underlining should be avoided. 
With these sizes, the interline distance should be set so that some 45 lines occur on a 
full-text page.
Headings. Headings should be capitalized (i.e., nouns, verbs, and all other words 
except articles, prepositions, and conjunctions should be set with an initial capital) and 
should, with the exception of the title, be aligned to the left. Words joined by a


hyphen are subject to a special rule. If the first word can stand alone, the second word 
should be capitalized. The font sizes are given in Table 1. 
  Here are some examples of headings: "Criteria to Disprove Context-Freeness of 
Collage Languages", "On Correcting the Intrusion of Tracing Non-deterministic Pro-
grams by Software", "A User-Friendly and Extendable Data Distribution System", 
"Multi-flip Networks: Parallelizing GenSAT", "Self-determinations of Man". 
Lemmas, Propositions, and Theorems. The numbers accorded to lemmas, 
propositions, and theorems etc. should appear in consecutive order, starting with the 
number 1, and not, for example, with the number 11.
